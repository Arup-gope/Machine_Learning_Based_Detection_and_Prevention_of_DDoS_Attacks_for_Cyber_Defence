# üíª Machine Learning Based Detection and Prevention of DDoS Attacks for Cyber Defence

> A robust and modular machine learning pipeline to detect Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using real-world CICIDS 2017 network traffic data. This project focuses on accurate classification of malicious traffic patterns and presents a complete experimental analysis using Python and LaTeX.

---

## üß† Project Overview

DDoS attacks pose one of the most severe threats to modern digital infrastructure. This project proposes a system using machine learning to classify traffic as either benign or malicious. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and label transformation
- Feature analysis and selection
- Model training using multiple classifiers
- Evaluation using standard ML metrics
- Confusion matrix & ROC curve visualization
- Full academic report (IEEE format)
